I. Methodology<br><br> 
Compiled and pre-processed 2546 rows of data from The Numbers in Excel and created visualizations in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christine.gonzalez4230/vizzes). 

Standardized and aggregated data based on the following:
1) Highest-grossing movies by genre, <br>
2) Total tickets sold by genre, <br>
3) Number of movies released each year by genre, <br>
4) Significant events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020, <br>
5) Classification of certain movies that fall under multiple genres

II. Data Limitations & Considerations:<br><br>
Firstly, I had to take special consideration in deciding which attributes to focus on. That included deciding between theater release dates and re-release dates on streaming platforms. In some instances, if a film does not generate enough capital at the box office, it is re-released on a subscription-based streaming platform where it gets more visibility. 

Lastly, many films fall under multiple genres, which makes it incredibly difficult to categorize and make accurate predictions for each genre. In most cases, I deferred to their primary genre, categorized accordingly, and analyzed historical data for any consistency in trends.
